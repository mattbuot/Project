# Title
Healthy food: from packaging to consumption

# Abstract
One of the highest stake of the century is to limit the damages made on natural resources. Understanding where the food is produced, packaged and consumed can show insights about the current issues. In some countries, there is a tendency to favor local products, we want to see if this is really the case and see how the food travels. Moreover, we would like to estimate the impact of those travels on the carbon footprint index.

In a later part, we will try to see if there is any correlation between the packaging of a product (color, shape, material) and its quality in terms of nutritious facts. Are there dominant colors in the packaging that could describe the overall quality of the food?

Our project is motivated by the idea of understanding these tendencies in the marketing behind the food industry, to have a good way to visualize those results and to see whether the use of machine learning for computer vision can bring some interesting insights. 

# Research questions
* How does food products travel before being sold?
* Which countries consume the best food in terms of nutritious facts?
* Which brands produce healthier and more environmental friendly food?
* Does packaging allows consumers to have a good idea of a product quality?

# Dataset
* Open Food Facts database: this database is organized in a csv file, we will probably consider columns such as 'nutrition_grade_fr' or 'carbon-footprint_100g'. There is also a 'image_url' which can be used to describe the packaging with some image processing or machine learning techniques.
